# Pause Parisienne

This project, named **Pause Parisienne**, was collaboratively developed by four contributors:
- [ArthurMns](https://github.com/ArthurMns)
- [Akeops](https://github.com/Akeops)
- [C4rpz](https://github.com/C4rpz)
- [UserWhoCode](https://github.com/UserWhoCode)

## Technology Stack
The application leverages **React** for the frontend along with vanilla CSS (no libraries such as Tailwind), while the backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express**. For the database, **SQLite** was used.

## Features
**Pause Parisienne** utilizes the [public toilets dataset API from data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/toilettes-publiques-4/) to geolocate various types of toilets on a map of Paris and allows searching through the toilet directory available in the capital. This idea was conceived to assist people during the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris.
